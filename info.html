                    <li>• Of the roughly 66,000 lbs CO2e emitted over the lifetime of an internal combustion engine car (assuming 93,000 miles driven), 84% come from the use phase.</li>
                    <li>• Gasoline releases 19.6 pounds of CO2 per gallon when burned, compared to 22.4 pounds per gallon for diesel.17 However, diesel has 11% more BTU per gallon, which improves its fuel economy.</li>
                    <li>• The average passenger car emits 0.78 pounds of CO2 per mile driven</li>

                    <li>• Residential space heating and cooling are estimated to account for 44% of energy in U.S. homes in 2020.</li>
                    <li>• 26 mmt CO2e are released in the U.S. each year from washing clothes. Switching to a cold water wash once per week, a household can reduce its GHG emissions by over 70 lbs anually</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>• Food accounts for 10-30% of a household's carbon footprint, typically a higher portion in lower-income households. Production accounts for 68% of food emissions, while transportation accounts for 5%.</li>
                    <li>• Food production emissions consist mainly of CO2, N2O, and CH4, which result primarily from agricultural practices.</li>
                    <li>• A vegetarian diet greatly reduces an individual's carbon footprint, but switching to less carbon intensive meats can have a major impact as well. For example, beef's GHG emissions per kilogram are 7.2 times greater than those of
                        chicken.

            <p>Solutions and Sustainable Actions</p>
            <ul>
                <li>• Reduce meat in your diet and avoid wasting food.
                </li>
                <li>• Walk, bike, carpool, use mass transit, or drive a best-in-class vehicle.
                </li>
                <li>• Make sure your car's tires are properly inflated. Fuel efficiency decreases by 0.2% for each 1 PSI decrease.
                </li>
                <li>• Smaller homes use less energy. Average household energy use is highest in houses (82.3 million BTU), followed by mobile homes (59.8 million BTU), apartments with 2-4 units (53.5 million BTU), and apartments with 5+ units in the building
                    (34.2 million BTU).</li>
                <li>• Whether you hand wash dishes or use a dishwasher, follow recommended practices to decrease water and energy use and reduce emissions.</li>
                <li>• Energy consumed by devices in standby mode accounts for 5-10% of residential energy use, adding up to $100 per year for the average American household. Unplug electronic devices when not in use or plug them into a power strip and turn
                    the power strip off.</li>
                <li>• Choose energy-efficient lighting and transition away from incandescent light bulbs.</li>
                <li>• Reduce what you send to a landfill by recycling, composting, and buying products with minimal packaging.
                </li>
                <li>• Purchase items with a comparatively low carbon footprint when possible. Some manufacturers have begun assessing and publishing their products’ carbon footprints.</li>
                <li>• Covering 80% of roof area on commercial buildings in the U.S. with solar reflective material would offset 125 mmt CO2 over the structures' lifetime, equivalent to turning off 32 coal power plants for one year.</li>
                <li>• Replacing the global fleet of shipping containers' roof and wall panels with aluminum would save $28 billion in fuel.</li>
